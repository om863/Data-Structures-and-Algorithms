## Creating a Linked List:

So, first we have to make a node -->


```py

class node:
     __slots__ = 'data', 'addr'
     def __init__(self, data, addr):
           self.data = data
           self.addr = addr
```
Now, create another class for linked list:


```py
class linked_list:
     def__init__(self):
         self.head = None             # Initialising a variable to None
         self.tail = None    
         self.size = 0
         
     def __len__(self):               # simply returns the size of the linked list. 
         return self.size
         
 ## creating a function for adding element:
 
     def add_element(self, data):     # this is the data value which will be given by the user/ input value.
         new_node = node(data, None)  # here we call the class node, and give two parameters ---> first parameter is the value of the data field, while second
                                      # parameter is the address of the other node.. for now we do not specify the address of the other node, so we fill this field
                                      # as None. We store this node in a variable called new_node
                                      
         if self.size == 0:
             self.head = new_node
         else:
             self.tail.next = new_node    
         self.tail = newnode
         self.size += 1
         
         
 ## creating a function for displaying the linked list:
     
    def display(self):
        p = self.head
        while p:
          print(p.data)
          p = p.addr
         

```
### Understanding the condition applied:
Below is the visualisation of new_node:

```py
if self.size == 0:
  self.head = new_node
```

here, we are checking whether --> is this node the first node.
If this is true, we will store the address of the new_node in a variable called self.head. 
By storing a variable in self.head, means that, head variable will be pointing to the address of new_node.
So, initially, for the first node, we will have something like shown below: (here I have considered that the input value is = 8):


![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60755716/103445372-220e4580-4c99-11eb-92b6-3bf1bebbf18f.jpg)


```py
else:
  self.tail.addr = new_node
self.tail = new_node
self.size += 1
```

Here, if the first condition fails, that means that already have a starting node, then we just have to connect the last element with the new_node.
Now, if you observe carefully, 

```py
self.tail = new_node
```

The above line of code is written after the else condition. The above line of code will execute every time irrespective of which condition is being followed.
So, for the first iteration, when we store the address of new_node in variable head, we also store the address of new_node in variable tail, like shown below -


![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60755716/103445475-7bc33f80-4c9a-11eb-9f78-9c9a3b03cf73.jpg)

Now, when this node is created and we again create a node, of value for eg: 11, then the "if" condition is not satisfied, now we already have a starting node.
So, we move to "else" condition -- which is ->

```py
self.tail.addr = new_node
```

Now, currently, our tail points to the first node. And this first node' address = None.
We need to fill the address field of the tail node with the address of new-node. 

#### IMPORTANT:
For now, when we are at adding the second node with the first node, head and tail both are pointing to the first node. By using self.tail.addr = new_node,
we are changing the address field of the first node, which means that, now our first node contains the address of second node, and hence first node points to the 
second node, and hence a link is created between the first and the second node.

Now we again move to -->

```py
self.tail = new_node
```
which simply means that, **now tail stores the address value of second node**, and hence now tail points to the second node, as shown below-->

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60755716/103445612-9c8c9480-4c9c-11eb-8122-bc83c3b56374.jpg)

```py
self.size += 1
```
The above line of code simply increments the size value, every time a node is added to the list.
So, every time a new node is added, the above steps are repeated.

### Display function:

Here, first we store the value which head stores, ie. the address of the first node, by -

```py
p = self.head
```

We are doing this, so that we can traverse through the entire list using "p", while keeping the variable head at the first position.
Now, we run a while loop, until  p = None.
This condition of p = None is only possible when we have traversed the entire linked list.
So, within the while loop -->

```py
while p:
  print(p.data)
  p = p.addr
```
here, print(p.data), prints the data of each node which satisfies the while loop, and p = p.addr, means that "p" traverses forward.

#### Understanding the meaning of --> p = p.addr :
Consider two nodes -->
Node A and Node B
suppose "p" points at Node A, then 
p.addr = address of Node B

So, by writting -->

```py
p = p.addr
```
we are actually, changing the address of p, and hence moving the pointer p from Node A to Node B
