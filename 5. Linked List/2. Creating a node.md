# Creating a Node:

So, as we know that, a node consists two fields i.e. 
1. Data
2. Address of the next node.

So, we have to create these two fields.

In python, we use 'class' in order to create a node.
A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

```py

class node:                          # any name can be given inplace of 'node'
     __slots__ = 'data', 'addr'      # In memory 'Class' is stored as a class of dictionary, which maps each attribute of a class with a memory location, which is 
                                     # quite inefficient for data strucutures. So to avoid this, we create slots for a class. Here we create 2 slots, named as data and 
                                     # addr. This step is not compulsory.
                                     
     def __init__(self, data, addr): # You must have observed that, while creating a class, we did not specify any attributes. So how do we get to know which data is to be
            self.data = data         # is to be inserted/ what are the input values. In python, we do not specify the attributes of the class while creating a class, instead we
            self.addr = addr         # create a function called ---> __init__(self). In this function, we specify all the attributes which the class will take as an input.
                                     # here, self refers to the self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to                                      # the class. We can use any name inplace of 'self'. 
                                    
     
```

So, here in our case, we create a node with 2 attributes, which the user have to give whenever we call the class 'node'; i.e -
1. data --> value 
1. addr --> address of the other node or it can be a NULL value.

#### Note:
meaning of -->

```py

self.data = data
self.addr = addr

```
Here, as we get the input value/data from the user we store that value in self.data. We use self here because for every instance this value will change.
So for eg:
first we gave 7 as the value for the data field of the node. 
So, when init function is called --

```py
def __init__(self, data, addr)

```
then, data = 7.
now, if we use --> data = data instead of using self.data = data, then --> we are fixing the value of data = 7, and for the next time when we change the value for eg: 8
then, the new value will overwrite the previous value. Whereas, we just want to use a particular value, for only that particular instance. Like, we want to use the value 7
only till when we are using this value/ only for that instance. So instead of fixing a value to a variable, we use - 

```py
self.data = data
```
which simply enebles us to work with a particular value for that particular instance, rather than fixing a value for the variable.

So, by using the above code, we can create a node consisting of two of its fields.
