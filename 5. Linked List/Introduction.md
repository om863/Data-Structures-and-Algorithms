# Linked List:

### Array:

We all know arrays, arrays is a data structure which can store multiple values of same data type in a sequencial manner. So for eg: 
an array can store 100 integers or 1000 floating numbers, etc.


[array](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.oracle.com%2Fjavase%2Ftutorial%2Fjava%2Fnutsandbolts%2Farrays.html&psig=AOvVaw2GV0bNa8kyIylf9jSrL9yR&ust=1609611079950000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCLjIg-Sq--0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD)

Like in the above picture, we can see that each element in array 'a' can be accessed through indexing. Index of an array usually starts from 0.
So, if we want to access an element for eg: 7 from the above array 'a', we can do this by - 
``` py

a[3]

```
So, if we can store elements in array, then what is the need for linked list?

### linked list:

The problem with arrays is the fixed amount of space which it provides. Sometimes, there can be a need when we actually don't know as how much size of the array to be 
considered. So, we want some data structure which stores elemetns, but dynamically. Which means that, we want such a data structure which can store elements, and increase
or decrease the size depending upon the input. So in this case we do not have to worry about the size of the data structure.
Arrays have fixed amount of space, and cannot increase or decrease this space.
Linked list overcomes this problem.

In python, Linked list creates a NODE.
